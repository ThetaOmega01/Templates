# Templates

This repository contains templates of LaTeX and Typst for my own use.
Most of them should work out of the box.

If you want to use them, you may need to change some of the custom font
settings. The following is an ongoing list of the customisations that
may not work elsewhere:

- In `typst/coursework.typ` and `typst/triposnotes.typ`:
  ```typst
  show raw: set text(font: "Liga SFMono Nerd Font")
  ```
